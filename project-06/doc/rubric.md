Data Science Immersive | Project 6

Your project will be assessed using the following standards, derived from the data science workflow:

- [ ] Identify Problem
- [ ] Acquire Data
- [ ] Parse Data
- [ ] Mine Data
- [ ] Refine Data
- [ ] Model Data
- [ ] Present Results

Acceptable performance for these standards is based on how well you've performed the specific requirements listed below.
