Project 1: SAT Scores
----
### Overview 
This week in class we went over some basic statistics, learned some Python programming concepts, and also learned how to navigate files, packages, and libraries using the command line. Great start! At this point you should be chomping at the bit to do some Data Science. If so, good - because it's time for Project 1!

For our first project, we're going to take a look at SAT scores around the United States. We'll be exploring this data to see what we can learn using the descriptive statistics skills covered this week. Your client, the College Board, is expecting some pretty graphs to add to their presentations this year, so don't let them down!

## Data
