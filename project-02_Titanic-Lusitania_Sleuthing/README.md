Project 2: Titanic-Lusitania Sleuthing
----

The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg.

Around the same time, the RMS Lusitania, a British ocean liner, was sunk by a German submarine during World War I. Both these sensational tragedies shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.

Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.

In this challenge, complete an analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.
